# CarND-Term2-P1-Extended-Kalman-Filter  
## Overview  
In this project, you are going to implement the extended Kalman filter in C++. You will be tracking the bicycle's position and velocity and predicting the positon of the object.  
There is a simulator provided by Udacity ([Term 2 Simulator Release](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/)) which can generate noisy LIDAR and RADAR measurements. And you will be using those measurements to predict your object position.  
Here is the link to the [orginal repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) provided by Udaciy.

## Setup Instructions (abbreviated)  
1. Meet the `Prerequisites/Dependencies`  
2. Intall `uWebSocketIO ` on your system  
  2.1 Windows Installation  
  2.1.1 Use latest version of Ubuntu Bash 16.04 on Windows 10, here is the [step-by-step guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) for setting up the utility.  
  2.1.2 (Optional) Check your version of Ubuntu Bash [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/278152/how-to-update-the-windows-bash-shell/).  
3. Open Ubuntu Bash and clone the project repository  
4. On the command line execute `./install-ubuntu.sh`  
5. Build and run your code.  

## Project Description  
* starter code in the `src` folder
* a README file with instructions on compiling the code
* a `Docs` folder, which contains details about the structure of the code templates
* `CMakeLists.txt` file that will be used when compiling your code (you do not need to change this file)
* a data file for testing your extended Kalman filter which the simulator interface provides
## Run the project  
* Clone this respository
* At the top level of the project repository, create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
* In `/build` directory, compile yoru code with `cmake .. && make`
* Launch the simulator from Windows
* Execute the run command for the project `./ExtendedKF` (Make sure you also run the simulator on the Windows host machine) If you see * * this message, it is working `Listening to port 4567 Connected!!!`

## Project Rubric  
### 1. Compiling  
#### 1.1 Your code should compile.  

### 2. Accuracy  
#### 2.2 px, py, vx, vy output coordinates must have an RMSE <= [.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52] when using the file: "obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt" which is the same data file the simulator uses for Dataset 1.  

### 3. Follows the Correct Algorithm  
#### 3.1 Your Sensor Fusion algorithm follows the general processing flow as taught in the preceding lessons.  
#### 3.2 Your Kalman Filter algorithm handles the first measurements appropriately.  
#### 3.3 Your Kalman Filter algorithm first predicts then updates.  
#### 3.4 Your Kalman Filter can handle radar and lidar measurements.  

### 4. Code Efficiency  
#### 4.1 Your algorithm should avoid unnecessary calculations.

Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project you will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/FusionEKF.cpp, src/FusionEKF.h, kalman_filter.cpp, kalman_filter.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protcol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project resources page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/382ebfd6-1d55-4487-84a5-b6a5a4ba1e47)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints and Tips!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.
* Students have reported rapid expansion of log files when using the term 2 simulator.  This appears to be associated with not being connected to uWebSockets.  If this does occur,  please make sure you are conneted to uWebSockets. The following workaround may also be effective at preventing large log files.

    + create an empty log file
    + remove write permissions so that the simulator can't write to log
 * Please note that the ```Eigen``` library does not initialize ```VectorXd``` or ```MatrixXd``` objects with zeros upon creation.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! We'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make.
